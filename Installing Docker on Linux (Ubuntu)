  Step-by-step installation guides for Docker on Linux and macOS, using methods recommended by Docker's official documentation.
1. Installing Docker on Linux (Ubuntu)
  Follow the official Docker installation guide for Linux for your specific distribution. We recommend using the installation script provided by Docker, which ensures you're getting the latest version without any issues.
   1. Run the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages:
      $for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
   2. Set up Docker's apt repository.
      # Add Docker's official GPG key:
      $sudo apt-get update
      $sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
      $sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings 
      $sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
      $sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

      # Add the repository to Apt sources:
      $echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
      $sudo apt-get update

3. To install the latest version, run:
    $sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    $sudo service docker start
    $sudo docker run hello-world

4.Check docker version:
   $docker version
